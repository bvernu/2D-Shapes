# 2D-Shapes
Builds a Picture, which is a collection of different Shapes (Circle, Triangle, Square, and Rectangle) defined with a class hierarchy. The program draws the different Shapes that make up the Picture (using simple 2D character graphics), calculates and prints their areas, and calculates and prints the total area of all the Shapes. Used concepts of inheritance, polymorphism, virtual functions, template classes, lambdas, and STL containers and iterators.

Implemented fully in C++ and Java seperately.
